<h1>Uncle Bentley's Must-See Movies</h1>
<h2>Three films that should not be overlooked</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Music Man</h3>
<p>The town of River City, Iowa takes a look at itself and learns valuable lessons from the huckster-turned-hero, Professor Harold Hill. There's music, there's romance, there's an ice cream social, and... Ye gods! A real-life brass band! Simpler problems from simpler times.</p>
<h3>Steamboat Willie</h3>
<p>Long before anime and Pixar came onto the animation scene, Walter Elias Disney and his brother, Roy, were working diligently to bring cartoon drawings to life, resulting in the 1928 debut of one of the world's most beloved characters, Mickey Mouse, and the start of one of the most profound creative empires to grace this planet.</p>
<h3>The Snowball Express</h3>
<p>This delightful movie from Walt Disney Studios is one of many that were produced in the 60s, 70s, and even 80s, giving us laughter, love, and life lessons through the zany adventures of everyday people. Dean Jones became a household name through these movies, as did many other actors at the time. But their feel-good qualities just make you want to have a better day because you took the time to watch them. (And I've wanted to run a small-scale ski resort ever since!)</p>
<h3>What do these movies have in common?</h3>
All three of these movies do what movies are supposed to do — allow you to escape into another world and rest, relax, and take a break from the cares and woes of everyday living. Be responsible some other day — now is the time for music, adventure, romance, space travel, or talking dogs. Escape and be free!

<h3>Honorable Mention — A Grand Day Out (Wallace & Grommit)</h3>
Nick Park's delightful foray into the world of stop motion animation is a treasure to behold. Both children and adults will fall in love with tireless inventor, Wallace, and his lovable, problem-solving dog, Grommit. It is the first in a collection of charmingly entertaining short films that includes "The Wrong Trousers" and "A Close Shave," as well as a few feature-length movies. Watch these gems from Aardman Animations whenever you can — they've been our family favorites for a few generations!</p>
